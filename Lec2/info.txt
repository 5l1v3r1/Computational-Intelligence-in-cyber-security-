aims at : supervised and unsupervised learning
Basic concept of clustering algorithms and clasification
Application in spam detection , intrusion detection , credit card fraud detection 

1. supervised learning : Train a machine using well labeled data == some data already tagged with correct answers 
Supervised learning algorithms analyses training data to produce outcome 
M/C already learnt everything just has to use it wisely .

in a NUTSHELL [ Learn from training set -> apply on test data set ]

two kinds of algorithms : 
1. classification : o/p variable is a category 
2. Regression : O/P is a real value 


eg : fruit detection from a pic 

2. unsupervised learning : training machine using data - neither classified nor labeled 
algo acts on data without guidance 

task of machine is to : group unsorted data according to similarities , pattern , differences w/o any prior training of data .
m/c finds hidden structure itself 

2 category of algo : 
1. clustering : discover inherent grouping in data 
2. association : discover rules that describe large portion of data : eg pple that buy X tend to look for Y .
