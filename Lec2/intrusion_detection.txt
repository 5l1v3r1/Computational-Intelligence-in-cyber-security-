malicious activity or policy violations

intrusion_detection_systems made :
An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software application that monitors a network or systems
for malicious activity or policy violations. Any malicious activity or violation is typically reported either
to an administrator or collected centrally using a security information and event management (SIEM) system.
A SIEM system combines outputs from multiple sources, and uses alarm filtering techniques to distinguish malicious
activity from false alarms.
