1.kind of unsupervised learning algorithm 
2.finds a structure in unlabled data 
def: process of organizing objects into groups whose members are similar in some way:

similarity criteria 
1.Distance : distance based clustering  // for higher dimensional data :minkowski metric 
2.conceptual clustering 


applications !!
1.Marketing: finding groups of customers with similar behavior given a large database of customer data containing their properties and past buying records;
2.Biology: classification of plants and animals given their features;
3.Libraries: book ordering;
4.Insurance: identifying groups of motor insurance policy holders with a high average claim cost; identifying frauds;
5.City-planning: identifying groups of houses according to their house type, value and geographical location;
6.Earthquake studies: clustering observed earthquake epicenters to identify dangerous zones;
7.WWW: document classification; clustering weblog data to discover groups of similar access patterns.


clustering algorithm must satisfy :
scalability;
dealing with different types of attributes;
discovering clusters with arbitrary shape;
minimal requirements for domain knowledge to determine input parameters;
ability to deal with noise and outliers;
insensitivity to order of input records;
high dimensionality;
interpretability and usability.


Clustering algorithms may be classified as listed below:

1.Exclusive Clustering:if a certain datum belongs to a definite cluster then it could not be included in another cluster.

2.Overlapping Clustering: uses fuzzy sets to cluster data, so that each point may belong to two or more clusters
with different degrees of membership. each data is associated to an appropriate membership value.

3.Hierarchical Clustering: union between the two nearest clusters,
beginning condition is realized by setting every datum as a cluster.
4. Probabilistic Clustering
